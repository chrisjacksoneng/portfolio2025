            <h4>About This Role</h4>
            <p>When I started at Waterloo, I set myself a goal of joining one of the prestigious design teams to really experience what the university has to offer. WAT.ai is one of those teams, and I was excited when I got in as a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> working on FORTif.ai.</p>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>The Project</h5>
              <p>FORTif.ai is an AI-driven companion designed to help seniors live independently. It's a pretty ambitious project that combines proactive safety monitoring with personalized daily support. The goal is to give seniors the confidence to stay in their homes longer while giving their families peace of mind.</p>
              <p>The system uses <strong>computer vision</strong> to continuously scan the home for potential hazards, such as spills, cluttered pathways, or tripping hazards. When it detects something, it provides clear, actionable recommendations to address the issue. At the same time, there's an AI chatbot that engages users in friendly conversations, offering medication and appointment reminders, wellness check-ins, and empathetic responses to questions.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>Hazard Detection</h5>
              <p>One of the core features I worked on was the <strong>hazard detection model</strong>. This uses computer vision to identify potential safety risks in <strong>real-time</strong>. Training a model to recognize things like spills or cluttered pathways requires a good dataset and careful consideration of edge cases like different lighting conditions or camera angles.</p>
              <p>We had to be careful about false positives too. You don't want to alarm users unnecessarily, but you also can't miss actual hazards. Finding that balance was challenging but really interesting from a machine learning perspective.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>AI Chatbot</h5>
              <p>The chatbot component was another major part of the project. It needed to be conversational and empathetic, which meant thinking carefully about how we structured prompts and responses. The chatbot handles everything from medication reminders to wellness check-ins to answering questions about health and safety.</p>
              <p>We also built in <strong>voice-to-text</strong> capabilities so users could interact with the system naturally, without having to type everything out. This made the whole experience more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>The Experience</h5>
              <p>Working on WAT.ai has been a great experience. The team is talented and passionate, and working on a project with real social impact has been really motivating. Getting to work with cutting-edge AI and computer vision technology while solving a meaningful problem is exactly what I was hoping for when I joined.</p>
              <p>It's also been great to collaborate with other disciplines, working with designers on the user experience and other engineers on the technical implementation while thinking about how to make the system actually useful for seniors. This kind of cross-functional work is really valuable.</p>

            <h4>About This Role</h4>
            <p>I came back to QQuote for a second term after really enjoying my first co-op there. This time, I wanted to focus on the software development side of things. Having done product management work in my first term, I was excited to get more hands-on with the code and apply what I'd learned about user needs to the technical implementation.</p>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>API Development</h5>
              <p>One of my main projects was working on a new <strong>API</strong> that would help both dealerships and our internal team automate their processes. I started by creating detailed specs for the API that defined the endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and error handling.</p>
              <p>This was great practice thinking about <strong>API design</strong> from a developer's perspective. I had to consider things like: What data do dealerships actually need? How should we structure the responses to be useful but not overwhelming? What edge cases do we need to handle? Having the product management experience from my first term helped me think through these questions with the end user in mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>QA Automation</h5>
              <p>I also worked on automating our QA process using <strong>Cypress.io</strong>. Manual testing was taking up a lot of time, and we needed a way to catch regressions quickly as we added new features. I built out <strong>automated test suites</strong> that would run on key user flows and critical paths.</p>
              <p>Learning Cypress was interesting because it's a powerful tool that lets you write tests that actually interact with the browser like a real user would. I had to think about what scenarios were most important to test and how to structure the tests so they'd be maintainable as the product evolved.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>The Experience</h5>
              <p>Coming back to QQuote for a second term was really rewarding. I already knew the team and the product, which meant I could jump into more complex projects right away. The combination of product management experience from my first term and technical work from this term gave me a much more complete picture of how software gets built.</p>
              <p>Working on API development taught me a lot about <strong>system design</strong> and thinking about how different parts of a system communicate with each other. And the QA automation work showed me the importance of having good test coverage and catching bugs early in the development cycle.</p>

I got to work across a bunch of different areas, from designing features to testing them. The team was awesome, and I liked it enough that I decided to come back for another term, this time focusing more on the technical side of things.</p>

Writing feature specs taught me to think through edge cases and user flows before any code gets written.</p>
              <p>I also got to work on prioritization and planning. Seeing how the team decided what to build next, balancing user requests with technical debt and business goals, was really valuable. It's one thing to know how to code, but understanding why you're building something is just as important.</p>

              <p>I learned to pay attention to details that I hadn't really thought about before, like spacing, typography, colour choices, and how different states look (loading, error, success). These small details make a huge difference in how users experience the product.</p>

              <h5>Building the Dashboard</h5>
              <p>One of the bigger challenges was building a dashboard that could handle real-time financial data without feeling laggy. I spent a lot of time optimizing how we fetched and displayed market data, using React hooks to manage state efficiently and implementing proper loading states.</p>
              <p>The portfolio tracking feature needed to show complex investment data in a way that made sense at a glance. I used <strong>Chart.js</strong> to create interactive visualizations that could drill down into specific time periods or asset classes. Getting the balance between detail and simplicity was tricky, but super rewarding once it clicked.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="role-subsection">
              <h5>AI Carousel Interface</h5>
              <p>I built a carousel interface to help users navigate through different AI prompt options. This made it easy for users to explore various research queries and see what the AI could help them with, without having to type everything out manually. When a user clicks on any analysis module, it opens a chatbot page with a pre-filled prompt based on what was clicked, immediately starting a conversation with the AI.</p>

              <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginTop: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                <li><strong>Coverflow Effect:</strong> This was one of the more complex features to implement. I built a custom React carousel from scratch using useState for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling. The coverflow effect required careful manipulation of CSS transform properties, z-index layering for proper depth perception, and optimized transition timing functions to ensure smooth animations.</li>
                <li><strong>Card Positioning & Navigation:</strong> I implemented a card positioning algorithm that calculated dynamic offsets based on the current index, handling edge cases for the first and last cards. The navigation logic involved debouncing to prevent rapid state changes and ensuring proper boundary conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> I spent considerable time optimizing the render performance, using React.memo where appropriate and minimizing unnecessary re-renders. I initially experimented with auto-rotation using useEffect and setInterval, but ultimately disabled it in favor of user-controlled navigation for better accessibility and intentional user interaction.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Here's a demonstration of the MVP I created, shared within NDA limitations.</p>

                    <strong>Paywall Implementation</strong>
                    <p>I built the access control logic for the different subscription tiers, including free trial, standard, and premium. This involved figuring out how to gate features properly and handle subscription states across the app. We also did extensive research on other paywall designs to find inspiration and analyze best practices.</p>

                    <p>I created scenario videos replicating what would happen on the live app and wrote comprehensive developer documentation detailing the paywall setup, configuration, and maintenance steps. We also documented the problems we encountered and how future developers should approach them.</p>

              <h5>System Architecture</h5>
              <p>We designed a comprehensive <strong>system architecture</strong> to handle user registration, subscription management, and content access control. The architecture integrated Firebase for authentication, Stripe for payment processing, and Firestore as the primary database.</p>
              <div style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
                <img

                  style={{
                    width: '100%',
                    maxWidth: '750px',
                    borderRadius: '8px',
                    border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
                    boxShadow: '0 0 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15), 0 0 40px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)',
                    filter: 'drop-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15))'
                  }}
                />
              </div>
              <p>The system included several key modules: a User Authentication Module for registration and initial setup, a Subscription Module for managing premium subscriptions, a Tier-Level Access Module for controlling content based on user roles, and an Admin Control Module for administrative oversight. The architecture ensured that content access was dynamically controlled based on subscription status, with Stripe webhooks keeping the system synchronized with payment events.</p>

              <h5>Technical Challenges</h5>
              <p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was with the Stripe integration and deployment process. Despite spending significant time troubleshooting and testing different approaches, we weren't able to fully overcome these deployment issues within the timeframe given. However, this experience taught me a lot about the complexities of payment system integration and deployment.</p>
              <p>We also ran into challenges with Stripe price configuration and Firebase rules. Working through these problems helped me understand the technical requirements behind payment gateways and the importance of thorough documentation for future developers.</p>

              <h5>The Experience</h5>
              <p>Working at Aeon was a great introduction to the startup world. The team was small, which meant I had a lot of ownership and got to see how decisions were made quickly. Working directly with Primie gave me insight into product strategy and how technical decisions impact the business.</p>
              <p>Working with payment infrastructure and subscription systems required learning to work within platform constraints and dealing with complex integrations, which taught me valuable lessons about flexibility and finding creative solutions.</p>
              <p>I'm proud of what we accomplished. We contributed concrete deliverables including paywall designs, architectural planning, and user flow strategies that will support future implementation. This experience strengthened both my design and problem-solving skills, while giving me a deeper appreciation for the collaboration and persistence needed to bring new features to life.</p>
